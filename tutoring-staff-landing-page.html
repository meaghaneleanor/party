						<p class="about-tutor">ABOUT JESSICA</p>
						<p class="tutor-bio">After graduating high school with honors, Jessica earned her Bachelor's in Environmental Biology with a minor in Psychology from Tulane University, where she was inducted into the National Society of Collegiate Scholars, Mortar Board, and Alpha Lambda Delta Freshmen Honor Society.</p>
						<p class="tutor-bio">Jessica then entered graduate school at the University of Missouri, where she spent more than six years studying acoustic communication in treefrogs. She spent most of her time caring for and researching hybrid treefrogs to better understand the genetic basis of their behavior. During the summers, she says: "I spent countless hours driving around Northwest Florida searching for and conducting field experiments with native treefrogs. It was an amazing and unforgettable experience!"</p>
						<p class="tutor-bio">After completing her Ph.D. in Biological Sciences, Jessica began her formal teaching career at a community college in Kansas City, Missouri. She has since moved to what she calls her "dream job," teaching Biology full time at Armstrong State University. She says: "I love sharing my love of biology with students! I absolutely love what I do!"</p>
						<p class="tutor-bio">Jessica began tutoring as an undergraduate, working as a tutor in math and statistics for the athletics department. During graduate school, she taught biology to non-science majors. "I have always enjoyed helping people learn," she says. "As a graduate student, I learned more about the science behind learning and education, and became more and more interested in understanding how best to teach people based on their own personal learning styles. I love putting what I love into practice both in front of the class and one-on-one with students. Through teaching, not only do I get to enhance the life of someone else, but I also learn a great deal during the process."</p>
						<p class="tutor-bio">Jessica spent a great deal of extra time as a graduate student studying about teaching and learning, taking courses on effective online teaching, college science teaching, active learning, and the Next Generation Science Standards for K-12. She has mentored elementary teachers and led workshops on the teaching of science. She has also conducted and published independent research on teaching and learning. One of those projects was recognized as the top research poster at the National Association of Biology Teachers annual conference in 2013.</p>
						<p class="tutor-bio">"I believe the best learning environment involves active learning and relevant information," Jessica says. "As an educator, my first priority is to figure out each student's personal learning needs. Every student learns differently, and I feel it is my job to pinpoint the most effective method to enhance their learning experience." She works to keep students mindful of their own goals and actively engaged in the material. By providing ample feedback, she strives to motivate them to go beyond their limits. "I truly believe that as a teacher my role is to be my students' cheerleader, actively pushing them towards greatness," she says.</p>
						<p class="tutor-bio">In high school, Jessica says, "I was a true band nerd," playing flute and piccolo in both concert and marching band. When she wasn't playing music, she was working on video journalism projects as part of her school's Cavalier Journal Club, which put on a live daily news show and bi-annual investigative journalism pieces for the school.</p>
						<p class="tutor-bio">For fun, Jessica loves outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and camping; action movies; videos games; crafting like sewing and crocheting; and spending quality time with family and friends.</p>
						<p class="tutor-bio">Fun fact: Jessica says, "After six summers studying reproductive strategies in male treefrogs--six summers observing frogs flirting!--I consider myself the 'frog love doctor'!"</p>
